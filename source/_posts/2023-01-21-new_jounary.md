description: start a new journey after leaving Bytedance, finally I can do something I want

> ps a lot of grammar errors when I enable grammar check :(

It's a little bit rush for me to leave since I set up my mind just in one week. But I had already prepared not to work in the service arch, so there is no reason for me to keep staying after the transfer failed.

I save some of my stuff from the lark doc and remove the internal link or any other things that would make security try to reach me. finally, I no longer have a relationship with Bytedance.

To keep continuing my thought, I need to practice English more often. ~~luckily, I found myself having some gift at it~~.  :(, a lot of grammar and spelling errors after I enabled Grammarly.  need to keep learning Japanese on Boshu, in case I accept the Japanese offer in the final.

learning AWS, trying to get an SAA certificate, learning GCP on Coursera, learning rust, oh hell, why there is more opportunity in rust than Golang, waste too much time on it. I Thought Golang would be a popular language, I learned rust for a while but I can't write shit.

If there is an order for locations I prefer to work, That would be London, Canada, Australia, and Japan. Maybe Japan could have higher priority, that would depend on the salary, heard that IT in japan won't have too high salaries like in China or US. but 8-9 million Jap yan should not be a big problem.

The world is big and wide, and I want to feel it by myself.
