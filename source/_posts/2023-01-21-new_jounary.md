description: start new jounary after i left bytedance, finally I can do something I want
---

It's a little bit rush for me leaving, since I sat up my mind just in week. But I had already prepare not working in the service arch, so there is no reason for me to keep stay after the transfer failed.

I save some my personal stuff from the lark doc, and remove the internal link or any other things that would make security try to reach me. finally I'm no longer have relationship with bytedance.

To keep continue my thought, I need to practise english more often. luckly, I found myself have some gift at it. And keep learning Japanese on boshu, in case I accept japanese offer in the final.

learning AWS, try to get SAA certificate, learning GCP on coursera, learning rust, oh hell, why there is more opporunity in rust than golang, waste too much time on it. Thought golang would be a popular language, I learned rust for a while but I can't write shit.

If there is order for locations I perfer to work, That would be london, canada, australia, japan. Maybe Japan could have higher priority, that would depend on the salary, heared that IT in japan won't have too high salary like in china or us. but 8-9 million Jap yan should not be a big problem.

The world is big and wide, and I want to feel it by myself.
