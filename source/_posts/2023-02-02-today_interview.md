It took about 40 minutes. The interviewer first introduced himself and the company to me. Explained to me the company's product and architecture in the big picture. I won't say I catch all of it. But I think I understand.

It's a startup in Japan, I don't know how can they pay me. And I don't think I'll work in this company, So It could be a practice for me and don't matter if I don't get the job.

I didn't spend too much time introducing my experience and project, He directly asked me some very open technical questions. I didn't answer them very well. But he said perfect every time I answered. Maybe he was just trying to be polite and make me comfortable

here is the list of technical questions e:

1. what is the advantage and disadvantages of docker and Kubernetes?
I took some time to think about it, So he changed the question to why do we need docker?

2. when do we need to use the message queue?
I didn't answer that so he change the question to when was your last time using a message queue?
Actually, I think I didn't understand the question at that time. I was wondering if he means the difference between Kafka and Rocketmq or when do we need to use mq. It's a really open question for the second one.

3. what technical problem you have faced and how did you solve it?
I said the plugin design. A little hard to explain for someone who hasn't used it before.

4. what is your favorite language and why?
I said rust. started from the article about Pingora.

while the rest are open questions

1. why do you choose us?
you are hiring, and I'm looking for a job. silly question.

2. why do you look for a new job? (I think he means why did you leave TikTok)

3. what do you think of working with the client and business company?

4. do you want to relocate to Japan or work remotely?

That is all I can remember. Preparing for the next interview and code assessment.
